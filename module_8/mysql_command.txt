mysql> help CHECK TABLE
Name: 'CHECK TABLE'
Description:
Syntax:
CHECK TABLE tbl_name [, tbl_name] ... [option] ...

option: {
    FOR UPGRADE
  | QUICK
  | FAST
  | MEDIUM
  | EXTENDED
  | CHANGED
}

CHECK TABLE checks a table or tables for errors. CHECK TABLE can also
check views for problems, such as tables that are referenced in the
view definition that no longer exist.

To check a table, you must have some privilege for it.

CHECK TABLE works for InnoDB, MyISAM, ARCHIVE, and CSV tables.

Before running CHECK TABLE on InnoDB tables, see
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/check-table.html#check-table-in
nodb.

CHECK TABLE is supported for partitioned tables, and you can use ALTER
TABLE ... CHECK PARTITION to check one or more partitions; for more
information, see [HELP ALTER TABLE], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-maintenance.html.

CHECK TABLE ignores virtual generated columns that are not indexed.

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and
can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [HELP UNION], and
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/subqueries.html. A SELECT
statement can start with a WITH clause to define common table
expressions accessible within the SELECT. See
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/with.html.

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There
  must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve
  rows. Its syntax is described in [HELP JOIN].

o SELECT supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION
  clause with a list of partitions or subpartitions (or both) following
  the name of the table in a table_reference (see [HELP JOIN]). In this
  case, rows are selected only from the partitions listed, and any
  other partitions of the table are ignored. For more information and
  examples, see
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/partitioning-selection.html.

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions
  that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an
  expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The
  statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE expression, you can use any of the functions and
  operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (group)
  functions. See
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/expressions.html, and
  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/functions.html.

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to
any table.
